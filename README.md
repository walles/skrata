# Skrata - Kids Writing App

Skrata is a text box. When you type it uses TTS to speak the most recent letter, the most recent
word and the full text.

The purpose is to encourage kids to play with typing.

The name is a combination of the Swedish word for write ("skriv") and talk ("prata").

# TODO before external beta testing
* Make the text size larger
* Add a Play button that reads the full text.
* Add a Clear button that clears the full text away.

# TODO before going public
* Add a way to switch between installed TTS languages.
* Add some sort of hint about how to install additional languages.

# DONE
* Remove the mail button. It's from a template and has no business being there.
