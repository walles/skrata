# Skrata - Kids Writing App

Skrata is a text box. When you type it uses TTS to speak the most recent letter, the most recent
word and the full text.

The purpose is to encourage kids to play with typing.

The name is a combination of the Swedish word for write ("skriv") and talk ("prata").

# TODO before going public
* Try it on Malva and see how it flies
* Add buttons for sending the text as a search string to Youtube
* Get feedback from at least one external beta tester
* Add a way to switch between installed TTS languages.
* Add some sort of hint about how to install additional languages.
* Remove the Settings menu item unless we use it for language switching.

# DONE
* Remove the mail button. It's from a template and has no business being there.
* Make the text size larger
* Replace "Skriv h√§r" with "Type here", make it translatable and translate it into Swedish
